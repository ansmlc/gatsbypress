### Fix error: 
- WP site missing "wordsby-menu" menu. Allow user to set a custom menu name via .env file? Or just avoid the error and render a message instead?
- Life of a Winner WP source: Blog pagination & category listing broken
### Improve:
- Breadcrumb category listing: skip showing 'Featured' cat
### Notes:
- WordPress permalink settings set to 'Post Name'. Default category and tag base slugs. Main menu supports pages only. Posts and categories will not have proper URL structure. 
- Author fields? "Publicly displayed name" is required
- Post and page excerpts are required. Do not use "Read more".
